    <p>This guide has been developed to ensure that adequate
    information is available for poultry smallholders in Latin
    America and the Caribbean for them to better prevent and
    control <code>Avian Flu.</code>
    The information is specifically intended to backyard and
    small-scale poultry production units. The guide therefore
    emphasizes on simple and inexpensive measures for
    disease prevention and control.
    However, this guide cannot be made available to the millions of poultry smallholders in the near future. It has therefore be decided to combine in this guide both
    information for poultry owners and information for field
    veterinaries and livestock experts, since they represent
    the major provider of animal health service to livestock
    smallholders, and therefore can better spread the
    message.</p>
    <p>Ideally this guide should be distributed by the staff of the
    District Veterinary Office (DVO) during a meeting gathering
    all field veterinaries from the villages / communes of the
    district. This meeting should be the occasion to discuss the
    contents of the guide, so that when Avian Flu is suspected
    in the district or nearby, both veterinaries and DVO have
    already discussed the issues.</p>

    <header>What is Biosecurity?</header>
    <p>It is a way to avoid contact between <code>animals
    and microbes</code></p>
    <p>Biosecurity may not cost too much money, it is mainly good
    practices to use in your farm.
    Principles of biosecurity can be applied in both large-scale animal production units and backyard or small-scale
    animal production units.</p>
    <p>For small-scale poultry production, biosecurity consists on
    various, simple, sometimes zero-cost measures that will:</p>
    <li>Keep microbes away from poultry.</li>
    <li>Keep poultry away from microbes.</li>
    <p>If biosecurity measures are not followed, we spend more
    time and more money in trying to solve the disease when
    it does appear.</p>
    <p>The principles of biosecurity may however be difficult to
    follow in cases like ducks scavenging in paddy fields. If
    you cannot apply biosecurity in these cases, you should
    make sure that these animals are kept separated from
    other poultry.
    Different measures of biosecurity can be applied in different
    circumstances. For example, if there are outbreaks of avian
    flu close to your farm, you must take stronger measures
    than in normal times. You can look at the following pages
    for details about the biosecurity measures to be taken
    according to the disease situation in your area.
     </p>
<li>Do not forget that biosecurity will help to protect your farm
against every disease, not only avian flu.</li>

     <header>No Outbreak</header>
    <p>With <code>Avian Flu</code>, there is almost never a time when the
    risk of getting the disease is zero. Even if you have not
    heard of outbreaks being reported in the province or in
    the country, there is still a risk of getting the disease.</p>
    <p>This is a low to medium risk situation.
    Keep the poultry in good condition. When you hear about
    an Avian Flu outbreak being reported in the neighbouring
    province , it does not mean that some farms close to yours
    or even that your farm is not yet infected. Poultry and
    human beings may have travelled from the infected area
    to your area before the disease was observed and the
    outbreak reported.</p>
    <p>By following some basic principles, a farm will remain
    free of disease. These principles are:</p>
    <li>Keep the poultry in good condition
    Keep the poultry in a protected environment</li>
    <li>Control the entries on to your farm</li>
    <li>Rely on yourself to keep your farm free
    of disease</li>

   <p>When you hear about an <code>Avian Flu</code> outbreak being
   reported in the country or in the province, it is possible
   that the disease is already very close to your farm. Poultry
   and human beings may have travelled from the infected
   area to your area before the disease was observed and
   the outbreak known.
   Consider that Avian Flu
   may be next door!
   This is a high risk
   situation!</p>
   <p>By following some basic principles, your farm will remain
   free of disease. These principles are:</p>
   <li>Keep the poultry
   in a protected
   place</li>
   <li>Do not buy or
   accept new
   animals on to the
   farm</li>
   <li>Decrease and
   control entries
   from humans</li>
   <li>Sweep the
   farmyard, clean
   the animal
   buildings, the
   equipment, the
   motorbike, more
   regularly</li>

 <p>When there are outbreaks reported in the province or in
 the country, everyone should be aware that they may get
 the virus. The <code>avian influenza</code> can be transmitted to human
 beings mainly through the faeces or by inhaling the virus
 that are spread by the infected birds when breathing.</p >
 <p>In non-infected poultry farms, only one person should
 take care of the poultry. This person should be an adult in
 good health. The pregnant women and the young children
 should avoid the contact with the animals.
 Don’t eat animals dead of disease, because you take a
 risk of getting infected by the avian flu when preparing
 the poultry.When there are outbreaks reported in the province or in
